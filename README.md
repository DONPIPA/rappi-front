## Development

To run the local environment you just need to install all the dependencies using `npm`

```
npm install
```

Then install gulp-cli globally, you need it to run the tasks

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

And finally just run gulp

```
gulp dev
```

This will mount a dev server in http://localhost:3000/
